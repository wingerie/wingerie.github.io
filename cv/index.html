                Product designer with experience in B2C products. Interested in building accessible, systematic and scalable products which help people in their day to day life. Prefer
to start working  from the very beginning of product development, helping product owners and managers figure out the exact problem we want to solve and prioritize it
in global scope of product evolution. When working on a solution, balance between
the user needs, business goals and technical opportunities. Working back-to-back with developers, figure out how exactly specific solution can be delivered, and help everyone to be on the same page. Have experience both in new and old products with heavy legacy.
